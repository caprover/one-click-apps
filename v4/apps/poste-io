Go to the **App Configs** of your deployment `$$cap_appname` here in CapRover\n2. Insert the following snippet into **Pre-Deploy Script**: `var preDeployFunction = function (captainAppObj, dockerUpdateObject) {var ports = dockerUpdateObject.EndpointSpec.Ports || [];ports.forEach(function (port) {port.PublishMode = \"host\";});return Promise.resolve(dockerUpdateObject);};`\n3. Go to the **HTTP Settings** and **Edit Default Nginx Configurations**\n4. Search for **last occurrence** of `location /.well-known/acme-challenge/` and replace `root <%-s.staticWebRoot%>;` with `proxy_pass $upstream;`\n5. **Save settings** and wait a minute\n6. Access your mail server at `http://$$cap_appname.$$cap_root_domain`\n7. Enter `$$cap_POSTE_HOSTNAME` in **Mailserver hostname**\n8. Enter an email address for the admin (you can also use `admin@$$cap_POSTE_HOSTNAME`) and create a password\n9. Navigate to **System Settings** > **TLS Certificate** and **Issue Free Letsencrypt.org Certificate**\n10. Check **Enabled** and **Save Changes**\n\nThe following steps guide you though the DNS configuration. Please **consult the documentation** (`https://poste.io/doc/configuring-dns`).\n\n1. Enter the admin panel of the server hosting or if you are self-hosting locally make sure you have access to the DNS configuration\n2. Create **PTR record** (also known as **Reverse DNS**) pointing to `$$cap_POSTE_HOSTNAME`\n3. Create **A** record for `$$cap_POSTE_HOSTNAME` pointing to the IP address of the server\n4. Create **MX** record pointing to `$$cap_POSTE_HOSTNAME`\n5. Create **TXT** record with value `v=spf1 mx ~all`\n6. Create **TXT** record with value `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@$$cap_POSTE_HOSTNAME ruf=dmarc-reports@$$cap_POSTE_HOSTNAME; sp=none; ri=86400` (you may need to change the mail addresses)\n7. Go to your application navigating to `http://$$cap_appname.$$cap_root_domain/admin/domain`\n8. Click **Show** on `$$cap_POSTE_HOSTNAME`\n9. In the line **DKIM Key** click on **Create New Key** and copy the generated value\n10. Go back to the DNS settings\n11. Create **TXT** record and insert copied value (starting with `k=rsa...`)\n12. Verify the DNS configuration using tools like MXToolbox (`https://mxtoolbox.com`)\n\nIf all your checks are green you are ready to create mailboxes.\n\nEnjoy your self-hosted mail server!"},"variables":[{"id":"$$cap_POSTE_VERSION","label":"General | Version","description":"Check out their Docker page for the valid tags https://hub.docker.com/r/analogic/poste.io/tags","defaultValue":"2","validRegex":"/.{1,}/"},{"id":"$$cap_POSTE_TZ","label":"General | Timezone","description":"Timezone for the application, find yours at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones","defaultValue":"UTC","validRegex":"/.{1,}/"},{"id":"$$cap_POSTE_DISABLE_CLAMAV","label":"Features | Disable ClamAV","description":"Whether to disable ClamAV anti-virus.
