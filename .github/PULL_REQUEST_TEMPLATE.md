First of all, thank you for your contribution! 😄


### ☑️ Self Check before Merge

- [ ] I have tested the template using the method described in README.md thoroughly
- [ ] I have ensured that I put as much default values as possible (except passwords) to ensure minimum effort required for end users to get started.
- [ ] I have ensured that I am not using the "latest" tag as this tag is dynamically changing and might break the one-click app. Use a fixed version.
- [ ] I have made sure that instructions.start and instructions.end are clear and self-explanatory.
- [ ] Icon is added as a png file to the logos directory.
