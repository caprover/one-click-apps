            Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software.

            It's documentation is available at: https://jenkins.io/doc/ 

            For more details about this container, see: https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jenkins/

            Enter your Jenkins Configuration parameters and click on next.

            To ensure Jenkins is securely set up by the administrator, an initial administrative password will be written to the log, available at the app Deployment tab, and this file on the server: /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword.

            It will take about a minute for the process to finish.
        end: Jenkins is deployed and available as $$cap_appname
