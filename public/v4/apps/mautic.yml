    instructions:
        start: >-
            Mautic is an online, marketing automation tool.
            The process will deploy a database and the App.
            The process will take about a minute for the process to finish.
        end: >-
            Mautic is now deployed and available as http://$$cap_appname.$$cap_root_domain

            IMPORTANT: 
            - It may take 1-2 minutes for Mautic to be ready. You might see a 502 error page during this time.
            - If you need an SMTP server, consider installing the 'poste.io' one-click app.

            To ensure HTTPS works correctly inside Mautic (for asset links and form submissions), follow these instructions exactly. You should probably copy and paste these somewhere until you're all finished:

            1. Enable HTTPS in CapRover for your Mautic app:
            - Do not enable 'force HTTPS' in CapRover yet, this way you'll see any problems more clearly. You can do this later.

            2. Wait 2 minutes or so, just to let Mautic fully set itself up with the database and everything.
            - You will see 'apache2 -D FOREGROUND' in the App Logs under Deployment in CapRover when it's finished setting up.
            - You can check Mautic is up and running by visiting the URL. It should say 'welcome to setup' or similar and show 'recommendations' about SSL.

            3. Tell Mautic's Apache server what our domain name is:
            a. Go to your CapRover dashboard and open your Mautic app settings.
            b. In "Environmental Variables", ensure these variables are set correctly:
                - APACHE_SERVER_NAME = $$cap_appname.$$cap_root_domain
            c. Find the "Service Update Override" section.
            d. Copy and paste this script (which sets apache server name, turns on https, and clears mautic cache every startup for smoother running):
                ```
                TaskTemplate:
                    ContainerSpec:
                        Command:
                        - /bin/sh
                        - -c
                        - |
                            echo "ServerName ${APACHE_SERVER_NAME}" >> /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
                            echo "SetEnvIf X-Forwarded-Proto https HTTPS=on" >> /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
                            rm -rf /var/www/html/var/cache/*
                            apache2-foreground
                ```
            e. Click "Save & Update" at the bottom of the page.

            4. Now revisit the Mautic URL:
            - You have to MANUALLY type https:// at the start of the URL.
            - You should notice the 'recommendations' have gone, and you are now ready to finish the setup.

            5. Verify HTTPS Configuration once setup is complete:
            - Log back into Mautic.
            - All links should now use HTTPS.
            - Create an asset and check its link, or
            - Go to System Info -> Recommendations (there should be no HTTPS-related recommendations).

            6. Final Step:
            - You can now enable 'Force HTTPS' in CapRover if desired.

            Following these steps will ensure Mautic is correctly configured for HTTPS in your CapRover environment.
