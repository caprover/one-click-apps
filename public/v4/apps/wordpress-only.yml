            WordPress is an online, open source website creation tool written in PHP. But in non-geek speak, itâ€™s probably the easiest and most powerful blogging and website content management system (or CMS) in existence today.

            Enter your WordPress Configuration parameters and click on next. A WordPress container will be created for you. The process will take about a minute for the process to finish. 

            Note: This app is intended for advanced users who'd like to have a central DB in a single container for multiple WP's. You should start by configuring your DB first and then comeback with all the DB Information.

            Wordpress is deployed and available as $$cap_appname-wordpress . 

            IMPORTANT: It will take up to 2 minutes for WordPress to be ready. Before that, you might see a 502 error page.

            Remember that this app will not create a Database by itself. You need to provide all that information.
    displayName: WordPress - No Database
    isOfficial: true
    description: This will create a WordPress only. You will need to create and configure the database information manually. Intended for advanced users.
    documentation: Taken from https://docs.docker.com/compose/wordpress/. Port mapping removed from WP as it is no longer needed
