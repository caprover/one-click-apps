            Valkey is a flexible distributed key-value datastore that supports both caching and beyond caching workloads.

            After installation on CapRover, it will be available as srv-captain--YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME at port 6379 to other CapRover apps.

            Enter your Valkey container name and click on next. It will take about a minute for the process to finish.
