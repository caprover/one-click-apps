            That's it! If you get a 502 it might mean that kibana cannot find your elasticsearch instance. Please recheck your configs.

            Ensure basic auth is enabled so your data is not publicly available.

            Provide the ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS so that kibana can find your elasticsearch instance. be sure to include the http:// protocol in the url.
