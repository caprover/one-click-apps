            Jellyfin is a Free Software Media System that puts you in control of managing and streaming your media.
            It is an alternative to the proprietary Emby and Plex, to provide media from a dedicated server to end-user devices via multiple apps.

            For more details visit- https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin

            PS. It might not work with RPi, or atleast, you wont be able to use OpenMax or V4L2 because Caprover ignores 'devices' parameters of docker-compose
        end: |-
            Jellyfin has been successfully deployed! Please wait atleast 2-4 mins before trying to connect. To enable HTTPS, enable it inside app config from caprover dashboard. 'Enable HTTPS' setting inside of Jellyfin might not work.
