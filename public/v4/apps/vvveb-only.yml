    instructions:
        start: >-
            Powerful and easy to use cms to build websites, blogs or ecommerce stores..

            Enter your Vvveb Configuration parameters and click on next. A Vvveb container will be created for you. The process will take about a minute to finish. 

            Note: This app is intended for advanced users who'd like to have a central DB in a single container for multiple Vvveb instances. You should start by configuring your DB first and then comeback with all the DB Information.
        end: >-
            Vvveb is deployed and available as $$cap_appname-vvveb . 

            IMPORTANT: It will take up to 1 minute for Vvveb to be ready. Before that, you might see a 502 error page.

            Remember that this app will not create a Database by itself. You need to provide all that information.
    displayName: Vvveb CMS - No Database
