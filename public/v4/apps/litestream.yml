    instructions:
        start: |-
            This one-click app will deploy Litestream, a standalone streaming replication tool for SQLite. It runs as a background process and safely replicates changes incrementally to a S3 bucket.
            To use this app, you need to enter your S3 credentials (access key ID and secret access key).
        end: |-
            Your litestream service has been deployed successfully!

            Important! Read this and take a screenshot so you can refer to it!

            By default, $$cap_appname-data volume, which is an empty directory, is mapped to your litestream data folder which is at /data inside the app. To change this:
            Go to CapRover > Apps > Litestream > App Config tab and change $$cap_appname-data to
            a) some other volume name such as "cap_appname-myappvolume" if you want litestream to access a sqlite database in this volume
            b) "/some/existing/path/on/host" if you want litestream to access a database on a specific path on the host.
            Don't change the "/data" part of the mapping as the "/data" is the directory inside the litestream container that is used to look for databases.

            The $$cap_appname-config volume stores the config file used by litestream. It can be modified, even after creation of the app but the container needs to be restartet in order to apply the new settings.
