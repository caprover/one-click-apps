This is not a security issue because SAML is tenanted and hence your Identity Provider will block access to anyone trying to log into your SAML tenant.

            Reduce Time to Market without sacrificing your security posture!

            BoxyHQ’s suite of APIs for security and privacy helps engineering teams build and ship compliant cloud applications faster.

            SAML Jackson can be used with any web application to integrate the Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication.

            NOTE: If you turn it to HTTPS, then dont forget change variables from 'http://$$cap_appname.$$cap_root_domain' to 'https://$$cap_appname.$$cap_root_domain'

            Note: This app is intended for advanced users who'd like to have a central DB in a single container for BoxyHQ Jackson. You should start by configuring your DB at you self, you can it do before or after you installed the BoxyHQ Jackson.
        end: >-
            BoxyHQ is deployed and available as http://$$cap_appname.$$cap_root_domain.

            NOTE: If you turn it to HTTPS, then dont forget change variables from 'http://$$cap_appname.$$cap_root_domain' to 'https://$$cap_appname.$$cap_root_domain'

            IMPORTANT: It will take up to 2 minutes for BoxyHQ Jackson to be ready. Before that, you might see a 502 error page.

            Remember that this app will not create a Database by itself. You need to provide all that information.
    displayName: BoxyHQ Jackson (SAML to OAuht) - No Database
    isOfficial: true
    description: This will create a BoxyHQ Jackson only. You will need to create and configure the database information manually. Intended for advanced users.
